Todo items
===

Here are some todo items for this project:

* x Push this to a new GitHub repository
* x Do any tagging necessary to get this onto packagist
* Make a clone of the Tag Monk project and remove the .git folder
* Do a git init to set up the test project as its own safe repository locally
* Do a composer require for the auditing library
* Test out the process of running the applier and viewing browser output
* Iterate as necessary to get everything working as it should be
* Per Steffen Grahl's good advice, use a strategy pattern and a config flag
  to allow users to specify whether we use regex or the php 8.4 html 5 parser
* Test some more to make sure everything is still working 
* Triple-check that the tool is checking out a new git branch when running,
  and that it fails loudly if this is not possible because of open changes  
* Test the whole workflow again 
* Publicize this via the Twig stack trace dumper readme and vice-versa
* Publicize it a little more via a burner Reddit account on the PHP Reddit forum
* Add supoort for Blade templates and publicize that
